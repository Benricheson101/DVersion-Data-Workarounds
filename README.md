# Discord Version Data Workaround

A repository that holds a variety of methods in multiple languages in obtaining Discord's build data such as build number, hash, and ID. This repository is named this way just to convey the many possibilities and ways of fetching the version data. The main objective is to have a diverse collection of ways to obtaining Discord app's build information.

## General
All (or at least most) of the methods have been documented and there is a schematic for how the data is returned. All the methods and functions are formatted as... well... methods and functions. They should be guaranteed to return the version data.

**Mini-Disclaimer**: These methods will generally get the latest version data.
